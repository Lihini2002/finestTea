            <h2>
                A Country Known for Tea</h2>
            <p>Introduced in 1867, Ceylon Tea has grown to be the top agriculture export in Sri Lanka and provides direct and indirect employment to nearly 1 million people while around 4% of the country’s land area is covered in tea plantations amounting to nearly 203000 hectares.</p>
            <p>Sri Lanka is an island made for tea. The country produces tea throughout the year and the total tea production is about 340 million kilograms per annum. Sri Lanka’s tea-growing areas are mainly concentrated in the central highlands and southern inland areas of the island.</p>
            <p>
                Sri Lanka's tea-growing areas are also divided into seven main regions based mainly on the terroir, namely Nuwara Eliya, Uda Pussellawa, Uva, Dimbula, Kandy, Sabaragamuwa, and Ruhuna. Each area produces a uniquely flavoured Ceylon Tea, mainly due to the contrasting elevation, climate, and terrain in each region.</p>
            <p>At present, a larger portion of the country's tea is exported as Ceylon Black Tea, while the country also produces Ceylon Green Tea, a type developed from Assamese seedlings. Ceylon White Tea, namely silver and golden tips is celebrated around the world for their finest flavour and are among the most expensive tea varieties in the world.</p>

        <h2>Nutritional Value of Tea</h2>
        <p>Tea composition varies with climate, season, horticultural practices and variety. Polyphenols are the most important component in tea, as they constitute approximately 36 percent of the dry weight of tea. Other components of fresh green leaf include caffeine, protein and amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins and minerals.</p>
        <p>Green and black tea have similar chemical make-up. The primary difference between the two types lies in the chemical changes that take place during their production. In black tea the plant Polyphenols are oxidized and this is prevented in the manufacture of green tea.</p>
        <p>One of the most important groups of Polyphenols in tea is the catechins in green tea, theaflavins and thearubigens in black tea. A variety of physiological effects have been attributed to tea catechins which are currently best known for their antioxidant activities.</p>
        <p>Black tea is all-natural (non flavoured) and contains no additives. It is virtually calorie-free (1 calorie per 100 ml) and sodium free and is therefore a suitable beverage for individuals on calorie-reduced or low sodium diet. Tea includes fluoride, traces of vitamins A, K, C, B carotene and B vitamins.</p>
        <p>Average daily consumption of tea in the United Kingdom, 3.43 cups (650 ml), provides very few calories and only a small amount of fat, whilst contributing valuable minerals and vitamins to the diet. It provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Over half of the total intake of dietary flavonoids.</li>
            <li>
                Nearly 16% of the daily requirement of calcium</li>
            <li>
                Almost 10% of the daily requirement of zinc</li>
            <li>
                Over 10% of the folic acid need</li>
            <li>
                Around 9%, 25% and 6% of vitamins B1, B2 and B6 respectively.</li>

        <h3>Why is Ceylon Tea Different?</h3>
        <p>The size of tea particles (known as the grade of tea) has no bearing on quality, and only influences strength. When we harvest tea leaves and make them into tea, we use the traditional, artisanal method - withering, rolling, and in the case of black tea fermenting and baking the leaf.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>While rolling, the leaf can become elongated and wiry, tightly curled or smaller particles which come out as OPA, Pekoe, BOP or finer Dust or Fannings grades. A single batch of good leaf can yield several of these grades and whilst they would all be good, the only difference in the size of particles would be the strength. That is related to the surface area of the leaf when brewed with hot water. A teaspoonful of Dust tea can have four times or larger surface area than the equivalent quantity of OPA, and hence offer better extraction, and thicker, stronger brew.</p>

            <h3>From 1824..</h3>
            <p>It was as far back as the year 1824 in which the British brought a tea plant from China to Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known at the time). It was planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya and is considered to have been the first non-commercial tea plant in Sri Lanka.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After nearly two decades in 1867, James Taylor, Scottish by origin, planted 19 acres of tea in the city of Kandy in Ceylon, at the Loolecondra Estate as the first commercial tea plantation. The eventual sale of Loolecondra teas resulted in 1872, in Kandy and the first tea consignment to London in 1873.</p>
